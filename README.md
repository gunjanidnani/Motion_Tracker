# Motion_Tracker
In this project I have build an object motion tracker by using python and opencv library.

For detection and tracking purposes, I have used the webcam of my laptop. Here, the object of given size(changeable) is detected and then I create contours(boundaries) for detection of the object.

After this, I compare two frames for tracking the movement of the object.
